# rgwadmin

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rgwadmin/badge/?version=latest)](https://rgwadmin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

rgwadmin is a Python library to access the Ceph Object Storage Admin API.

http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/adminops/


## API Example Usage

```python
from rgwadmin import RGWAdmin

rgw = RGWAdmin(access_key='XXX', secret_key='XXX', server='obj.example.com')
rgw.create_user(
    uid='liam',
    display_name='Liam Monahan',
    email='liam@umiacs.umd.edu',
    user_caps='usage=read, write; users=read',
    max_buckets=1000)
rgw.set_user_quota(
    uid='liam',
    quota_type='user',
    max_size_kb=1024*1024,
    enabled=True)
rgw.remove_user(uid='liam', purge_data=True)
```

## User Example Usage
```python
from rgwadmin import RGWAdmin, RGWUser

RGWAdmin.connect(access_key='XXX', secret_key='XXX', server='obj.example.com')
u = RGWUser.create(user_id='test', display_name='Test User')
u.user_quota.size = 1024 * 1024  # in bytes
u.user_quota.enabled = True
u.save()
u.delete()
```

## Requirements

rgwadmin requires the following Python packages:

 * [requests](http://python-requests.org/)
 * [requests-aws4auth](https://github.com/tedder/requests-aws4auth)

Additionally, you need to have a [Ceph](http://www.ceph.org) Object Storage
instance with a user that has appropriate caps (capabilities) on the parts of
the API that you want to access.  See the
[Ceph Object Storage](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/) page for more
information.

Version 2.3.1 was the last to support Python 2.  As of version 2.4.0 we support 
using V4 signing for requests to the Ceph RGW Admin server only.

### Compatibility
rgwadmin implements all documented Admin API operations or recent versions of
Ceph.  We also implement some of the undocumented ones, too...

## Installation

```pip install rgwadmin```
